This code is from Startup Weekend Pittsburgh #5 and includes all the code to run the Meteorjs application. 

Credit for the logo goes to Al Davis (flippoapp.com), a shout out to Aaron Zhang (thinkero.us) for helping get a lot of this started, and thank you to Steve McCarthy (megabitsapp.com, etc) for helping with the scaffolding the styling.

I'd like the rest of the Inquizit team (James Kong, et al) for having me on board to help them develop their MVP for the Sunday presentation.



Onto the app itself, it is a simple real-time polling application written in MeteorJS (0.8.x). This iteration requires injection of presentations (mongo + dev console) to initialize the list (for presentation purposes).

Feel free to email me at hestinr12@gmail.com for questions or if interested in discussing possible beta sign up for any conference or presentation.
